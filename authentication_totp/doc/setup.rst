Enabling TOTP authentication
============================

After you have activated the *Authentication TOTP Module* to enable
:abbr:`TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords)` authentication you need to add
the ``totp`` method to the
`authentications <trytond:config-session.authentications>` setting in the
``session`` section of the
:doc:`configuration file <trytond:topics/configuration>`.
