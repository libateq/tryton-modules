Selecting chart variants
========================

You will normally select which chart variants you want to use when you are
`Setting up the accounts structure <account:Setting up the accounts structure>`
for your company.

You can also do this at a later stage by opening the top-level
`Account <model-account.account>` from your chart of accounts and changing
which variants it is associated with.

.. note::

   Variants for a chart of accounts are provided in additional third-party
   modules.
   You will need to activate one or more of these additional modules in order
   to use chart variants.
